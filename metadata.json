        "Prediction of clinically relevant drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) based solely on drug structure using binary classification methods. The results presented here are useful as a screening tool both in a clinical setting in the assessment of DILI as well as in the early stages of drug development to rule out potentially hepatotoxic candidates."
