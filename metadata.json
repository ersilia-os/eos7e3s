    "Title": "Drug-induced liver injury prediction",
    "Description": "Prediction of clinically relevant drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI), based solely on drug structure using binary classification methods. The authors collected a public dataset of 475 molecules with associated DILI outcomes, and built a model with an accuracy of 0.89. The model checkpoints have not been provided so Ersilia has used the provided data to retrain the model.",
